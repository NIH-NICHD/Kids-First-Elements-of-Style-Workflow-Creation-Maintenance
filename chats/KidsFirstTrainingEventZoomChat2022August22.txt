12:04:09 From Diana Ma to Everyone:
	I have successfully started a project. How do I get to the Jupyter interface?

12:09:22 From Anthony Corbett to Everyone:
	My clone didn‚Äôt fail with unauthorized. Do I still need to install the gh CLI from conda-forge?
12:09:45 From Youn Jee to Everyone:
	could you please repeat where to copy "https..."?
12:10:32 From David Higgins (Kids First DRC) to Everyone:
	The directions Anne is walking Ousmane through are linked here: https://github.com/NIH-NICHD/Kids-First-Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance/tree/main/classes/Running-a-JupyterLab-Notebook#readme

12:21:35 From Pierrette Lo to Everyone:
	nm, I was trying to type it into the jupyter nb. it works in the terminal window!
12:23:21 From William Schleif to Everyone:
	can you copy that link in chat? I don't see that in my notebook
12:24:28 From Ousmane Sow to Everyone:
	Thanks! great teacher!
12:24:45 From Pierrette Lo to Everyone:
	üëç
12:24:51 From Diana Ma to Everyone:
	still having problems, but getting help
12:24:58 From Soumya Rao to Everyone:
	I was left behind, so just watched and learnt.
12:25:06 From Diana Ma to Everyone:
	will do
12:25:26 From Soumya Rao to Everyone:
	I will stay after the session.
12:25:29 From Reona Okada to Everyone:
	So what actually is a ‚ÄúNotebook?‚Äù
12:26:38 From James Coulombe to Everyone:
	got lost with trying to start github on the same computer that I had cavatica running on and creating a fork.
12:32:05 From Pierrette Lo to Everyone:
	i'm getting this error: Error: package or namespace load failed for ‚Äòggplot2‚Äô in loadNamespace(i, c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[i]]):	 namespace ‚Äòrlang‚Äô 0.4.11 is already loaded, but >= 1.0.0 is required
12:32:21 From Anthony Corbett to Everyone:
	If you restart your kernel
12:32:21 From Kerry Goetz to Everyone:
	and googling the error. lol
12:32:26 From Gabrielle Altman to Everyone:
	i got that error but restarted my kernel and it worked
12:32:30 From Anthony Corbett to Everyone:
	and then don't re-run the install cell
12:32:38 From Matthew Galbraith to Everyone:
	Problem with ggplot2 and rlang
12:32:48 From Matthew Galbraith to Everyone:
	seems to be installing old version of rlang
12:33:01 From Anthony Corbett to Everyone:
	I got the same error and it's because when you install rlang we need to restart the kernel so that newer version loads
12:35:02 From Anthony Corbett to Everyone:
	don‚Äôt re-run the install cell
12:35:11 From Gabrielle Altman to Everyone:
	i reran it and it worked
12:35:18 From Anthony Corbett to Everyone:
	it will still work but it is just re-doing work
12:35:53 From Mary Allen to Everyone:
	restating the kernal worked for me too
12:35:54 From Pierrette Lo to Everyone:
	thanks Anthony - it worked for me. Just choose "restart kernel" and not "restart and clear outputs"
12:36:01 From Tonia Carter to Everyone:
	How to fix error message: bash: syntax error near unexpected token `"rlang"'
12:40:32 From Reona Okada to Everyone:
	Where are we installing this package with ‚Äúinstall.packages‚Äù?
12:40:57 From Diana Ma to Everyone:
	Where is the "commandline" on my Cavatica Analysis interface?
12:41:23 From David Higgins (Kids First DRC) to Everyone:
	Command line is the left most tab in the top left. A black square is the symbol
12:41:24 From Diana Ma to Everyone:
	sorry.  Where is the "terminal"
12:42:03 From Anthony Corbett to Everyone:
	ggplot is already a transitive dependency of EnhancedVolcano and needs rlang >= 1.0.0 which you do have installed. However, the new version of rlang isn't loaded yet and the old version of rlang is.
12:42:08 From Sarah Ben Maamar to Everyone:
	I tried to run the code in the Appendix part but I get the following error:
12:42:18 From Sarah Ben Maamar to Everyone:
	‚ÄúError in parse(text = x, srcfile = src): <text>:7:15: unexpected '@'
	6: 
	7: levels(airway@@
	                 ^
	Traceback:
	‚Äã
	
	"
12:42:29 From Sarah Ben Maamar to Everyone:
	I copied it in the cell
12:42:33 From Sarah Ben Maamar to Everyone:
	ok makes sense
12:42:38 From Sarah Ben Maamar to Everyone:
	thnka you!
12:42:57 From Anthony Corbett to Everyone:
	@Sarah I think there is a missing close parenthesis on that line 7
12:43:08 From Kerry Goetz to Everyone:
	are we trouble shooting at this stage and free to return tomorrow if we're all good?
12:43:53 From Reona Okada to Everyone:
	I mean, when I use R on my PC and run ‚Äúinstall.packages‚Äù, it's installed to my local PC, so I just have to install it once. But in this cloud (?) situation, where is it installed? Do I need to run ‚Äúinstall‚Äù every time I work on this?
12:44:43 From Sarah Ben Maamar to Everyone:
	Thank you @Anthony, I added the parenthesis but it still throws an error. It seems related to the @@ signs but I am not sure what this is
12:44:50 From David Higgins (Kids First DRC) to Everyone:
	I think that's the bulk of today Kerry - troubleshooting and helping to review. But we'll be back tomorrow to learn about Github actions.
12:45:53 From Karl Kuntzelman to Everyone:
	Worried about your dog, Anne
12:46:01 From Anthony Corbett to Everyone:
	@Sarah, oh don‚Äôt copy paste the formatted markdown code. Double click on the code and get the raw code
12:46:42 From William Schleif to Everyone:
	how are resources determined for high demand jobs that I'd typically run on a cluster? Or is this meant only for high level analysis?
12:46:47 From Anthony Corbett to Everyone:
	the ‚Äú@@0@@" is a markdown formatting issue. The real code is levels(airway$dex) with a dollar sign
12:49:40 From Sarah Ben Maamar to Everyone:
	oooh that makes sense! Thank you Anthony! I am missing the DESeq2 library. Tried to install it but R says it is not available for this version of R. Nevermind I was just playing around :-)
12:52:16 From Anthony Corbett to Everyone:
	Sarah DESeq2 is usually installed via bioconductor like so:  if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
	    install.packages("BiocManager")
	
	BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
12:54:38 From Anthony Corbett to Everyone:
	Yes unless you stop the Data Studio VMinstance
12:55:23 From Robin Dowell to Everyone:
	Anne -- this was a great start!  Looking forward to tomorrow but I have to run today....
12:56:08 From Anthony Corbett to Everyone:
	So the ‚Äúsaving‚Äù is it backed by a ESB block device?
12:57:03 From Sarah Ben Maamar to Everyone:
	@anthony, you are right. DESeq2 install worked!
12:57:16 From Sarah Ben Maamar to Everyone:
	thank you!
12:58:59 From Anthony Corbett to Everyone:
	welcome!
12:59:23 From Matthew Galbraith to Everyone:
	Sarah the ‚Äúnot available" for this version of R often means that it is a Bioconductor package
13:00:54 From Anthony Corbett to Everyone:
	in the R kernel it seems that the .libPaths() is stored at /opt/conda/lib/R/library  and the / (root) is a overlay filesystem. So is this overlay filesystem persisted between restarts of the Data Studio instance?
13:01:19 From William Schleif to Everyone:
	Thank you!
13:01:29 From David Higgins (Kids First DRC) to Everyone:
	Thanks everyone! See you tomorrow!
13:01:31 From Ousmane Sow to Everyone:
	enjoy your day all!
13:01:32 From Karl Kuntzelman to Everyone:
	@Anthony - apologies if I missed some context in the conversation, but I believe the default configuration is just using the ec2 instance storage and not persisting anything once the vm is terminated
13:01:35 From Meghan Hartwick to Everyone:
	Hi - I am CAVATICA username hartwickma - can I be added to the billing group?
13:01:54 From David Higgins (Kids First DRC) to Everyone:
	Just added you Meghan!
13:02:14 From Soumya Rao to Everyone:
	Please share the recording as well. I need to go now but I will follow it later today.
13:02:27 From David Higgins (Kids First DRC) to Everyone:
	Now that you're in Meghan, you can follow the directions here: https://github.com/NIH-NICHD/Kids-First-Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance/blob/main/classes/Lets-Dive-In/StartingAJupyterLabNotebook.md#starting-a-jupyterlab-notebook
13:02:34 From Rohan Mane to Everyone:
	Sorry, But I was not able to attend the introductory class conducted on 19th August. If there is a recording can you please share it. Thank you!
13:02:49 From Anthony Corbett to Everyone:
	@Karl I think I agree with you that it is local EC2 storage, but the "saving" when someone stopped the instance had be thinking..
13:02:55 From Rohan Mane to Everyone:
	And the recording of today's class as wellüòÖ
13:03:01 From Meghan Hartwick to Everyone:
