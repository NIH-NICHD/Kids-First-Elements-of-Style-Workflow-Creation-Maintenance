10:59:43 From David Higgins (Kids First DRC) to Everyone:
	Hi everyone! Welcome back! Looking forward to a great Day 2!
11:04:38 From Anne Deslattes Mays to Everyone:
	https://github.com/NIH-NICHD/Kids-First-Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance
11:05:58 From David Higgins (Kids First DRC) to Everyone:
	Today's agenda in our course materials: https://github.com/NIH-NICHD/Kids-First-Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance#agenda-for-the-day-2-code-versioning
11:07:58 From David Higgins (Kids First DRC) to Everyone:
	If you missed yesterday's session, you can catch up following these directions here: https://github.com/NIH-NICHD/Kids-First-Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance/blob/main/classes/Workspace-Setup/README.md#starting-from-scratch
11:16:07 From David Higgins (Kids First DRC) to Everyone:
	The files from Zenodo are copied, so you're storing a copy. Any files you get from the Kids First Portal are stored on our AWS and you just receive access to them, so there's no real "copy" so there's no storage for these.
11:16:20 From Mary Allen to Everyone:
	awesome!
11:16:21 From Mary Allen to Everyone:
	thanks
11:16:36 From Matthew Galbraith to Everyone:
	How can one tell if a file is a real copy or not?
11:24:22 From David Higgins (Kids First DRC) to Everyone:
	Matthew: it depends on where the files come from. Files pushed from the KF Portal, or any of the CAVATICA datasets are stored by us, so there's no storage for those. You can also attach your own cloud storage to your project so you can access files there. There are more details in Cavatica's docs, I'll share links here.

	We want "Kids-First-Elements-of-Style..." for our course
12:21:52 From William Schleif to Everyone:
	yes I know but yesterday I forked the older one, which is why I can't sync using the lessons today
12:22:48 From William Schleif to Everyone:
	mentioning it in case anyone else has the same issue
12:23:58 From Anthony Corbett to Everyone:
	undo your commit or amend it as it still has the old email in the commit
12:24:50 From Anthony Corbett to Everyone:
	meaning if you made the commit first, then updated your git user.email then the local commit still has your old, non-public, email
12:26:19 From Anthony Corbett to Everyone:
	git commit --amend --author="John Doe <john@doe.org>"
12:29:05 From Zhen Liin to Everyone:

	We'll miss you tomorrow Qingguo. Iâ€™ll continue to share the videos throughout the week. Hope to see you back on Thursday!
12:40:04 From Kerry Goetz to Everyone:
	this is part of the GDS policy
12:40:43 From Anthony Corbett to Everyone:
	If I have person access to a dbGaP/SRA study that isn't on Kids-Frist already can I connect it to Kids-First/CAVATICA?
12:41:16 From Anthony Corbett to Everyone:
	or would I have to use SRA tools to dump them into CAVATICA project storage manually first then run my workflows?
12:45:58 From Heather Basehore to Everyone:
	Is it consented data for secondary use?
12:46:26 From David Higgins (Kids First DRC) to Everyone:
	Anthony - it depends upon the study in question. We've been collaborating with other NIH-funded projects to allow for interoperability between our datasets and platforms. We're still working through it, but if the dbGaP phs is in this list, we might be able to make it accessible in Cavatica without copying it. https://anvilproject.org/ncpi/data
12:46:46 From Heather Basehore to Everyone:
	Yes
12:47:30 From Hendrick Lim to Everyone:
	@Anthony: in CAVATICA, there is a Public Apps tab where you can find SRA fasterq-dump tool to download the SRA study data
12:47:35 From Anthony Corbett to Everyone:
	@David Thank you
12:47:55 From Anthony Corbett to Everyone:
	@Hendrick thanks Iâ€™ll take a look
12:49:16 From Anne Deslattes Mays to Everyone:
	GA4GH DRS services for data -- SRA and dbGaP will make their data (metadata as well as omics) using DRS
12:50:02 From Anne Deslattes Mays to Everyone:
	https://sra-explorer.info/
12:54:39 From Anne Deslattes Mays to Everyone:
	GA4GH passports
12:56:08 From Diana Ma to Everyone:
	Thank you!!!!
13:03:34 From Youn Jee to Everyone:
